Overlay StreamPULSE and MTBS and map

Tasks: 
1. A map of CONUS with points of streamPULSE sites and outlines of wildfire perimeters from MTBS
2. A table with each row being one of the watersheds and columns providing summary information such as the fraction of the watershed areas from the streamPULSE sites that are burned, size of the watersheds, the dominant biome/vegetation, summary climate variables, and whatever other high level summary attributes we use to know more about the distribution of watersheds where the data are available. Similarly to ST1 Task 1, a key element is for the datasets to span diverse environments across CONUS for this broadly transferable, so the watersheds where the data exist must be environmentally diverse.
3. ID if there are key ecoregions or biomes where the data is missing. (i.e. a place with a lot of fires but little streamPULSE data)
